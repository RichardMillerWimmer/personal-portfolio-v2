Thank you for taking a look at my Personal Portfolio.

This was built using Astro a static site generator. This was done to use almost no Javascript to provide a super fast static site with the developer experience that modern frameworks provide. 

Please feel free to take a look around. You will find articles I have written and my personal projects I have built.
