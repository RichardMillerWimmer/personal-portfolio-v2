          Allow me to introduce myself, My name is Richard, and I'm a software engineer/developer. The Cincinnati Northern
          Kentucky area is home to my family and I. Along with development I enjoy spending time with my family, going to
          the Cincinnati museum, zoo, woodworking, and working out.

          My development focus has been on frontend engineering using popular frameworks creating reusable dynamic
          components to create the best user experience possible. With an eye for design I love bringing concepts and
          wireframes to life. I have a passion for web accessibility and providing the best possible experience and use
          for all.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a life long learner I have gathered skills in development/engineering and many complementary skills. Some of
          these include German language, leadership, mentoring, music, graphic design, video, social media content and
          strategy.
