            My development focus has been on frontend enginnering using popular frameworks creating reusable dynamic componenets to create the best user expereince possible. With an eye for design I love bringing concepts and wireframes to life. I have a passion for web accessibility and providing the best possible experience and use for all.

          As a life long learner I have gathered skills in development/engineering and many complementary skills. Some of these include German language, leadership, mentoring, music, graphic design, video, social media content and strategy.
