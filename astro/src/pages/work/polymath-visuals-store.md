The purpose of this project was to demonstrate building a React app from the ground up. The timeline for this project was just under three weeks, but has been revisited for various refactors and updates.

This application is designed to create a platform for Polymath Visuals, a 3D and motion design company, giving the ability to distribute and sell plugin and texture packages for use with Cinema4D. There are two sides of the application. The admin side which controls products and the user side which has the ability to browse and purchase those products. Restful api used to control admin and user functionality.

The project is build using React with Typescript on the Frontend, Nodejs on the Backend, and PostgreSQL for the Database.
