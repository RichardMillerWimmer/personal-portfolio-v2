A professional academic portfolio page Valerie Miller PhD OTL/R. Built using Next.js for the frontend and Contentful for the data. This app takes advantage of Next.js' static site generation for improved performance and SEO. Contentful was chosen because this CMS easily allowed for a handoff to the client to manage her own content.

<br />

The goals for this client were to create more visibility for her academic achievements, work and research. This was done to help generate more opportunities for speaking engagements, research, and community partnerships related to the clients experience and expertise.
