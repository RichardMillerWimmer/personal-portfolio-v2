This is my personal portfolio project. I have built this to highlight work, articles, and experience. 
<br />
My portfolio is built using Astro for a blazing fast user experience. This site also uses React for stateful components using Astro's island architecture and Astro hydration API. Markdown is utilized for developer experience with Astro's .md and .mdx integrations.
