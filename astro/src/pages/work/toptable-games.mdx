This web application is designed to create a platform for users to track their game collections and then rate and review them for others to see. A user is able to make an account add games to their collection, rate, review, and track plays per game. Users do not need to have an account nor do they need to login to browse games and see reviews for those games from other users.

<br />
Board Game Atlas' API was used for all the game data along with our relational database
in PostgreSQL. The application is full CRUD implementing RESTful APIs.
<br />
The duration of the project was just under three weeks from start to its final due
date.
